 summary = {Gibson et al. study 100 lead workers from different industries who have been diagnosed with lead poisoning. 91 of their subjects were in hospital and the other 9 were still at work. Their objective was to define more clearly the clinical and biochemical criteria of different stages of lead poisoning. Their research established that although blood lead level does not differ between lead toxicity and lead exposure, finding values above 60µg. lead/ 100g. Blood justifies a physician needing to conduct further tests. They also found that scrap metal burning, battery manufacturing, and ship-breaking constituted the most dangerous lead hazards in the workplace. As such, lead workers in these industries should have greater medical supervision and training. Gibson’s work is valuable because it is a primary source in which she focuses on giving facts, not opinions, on industrial lead poisoning. Moreover, she has published other studies related to hard-metals, such as “Reconstructing the Serapeum in Alexandria from the archaeological evidence” in the Journal of Roman Studies (Vol 94, Cambridge University Press.) Nevertheless, this research uses old evidence from the 1960s and may not be as applicable today as in the past.},

 summary = {Hodgkins and his associates explore the relationship between lead in air (PbA) and lead in blood (PbB) concentrations among 44 workers from 5 different U.S. lead-acid battery plants. The scientists employed univariate and multivariable linear regressions and longitudinal analyses to model lead concentrations in the workers. They created a model to predict PbA and PbB relations in battery workers and found that the results from their model aligned closely to the results found by the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration). This study is a primary source as Hodgkins et al. conducted their own research over a 30-month period. They also created the model they used to predict PbA and PbB relationships. Furthermore, their findings have been featured in other journals such as The British Journal of Diseases of the Chest Vol 71 (1977). However, it is a wordy document with substantial uses of statistics and scientific vocabulary. It is not intended for a general audience, and this is reflected in the fact that the work has only been cited 26 times despite being published in 1992.},

summary = {In this study, Julander et al. seek to evaluate e-waste workers’ exposure to metals using biomarkers of exposure and by monitoring personal air exposure. The researchers assessed the exposure of 20 potentially toxic metals among 55 recycling workers and 10 office workers in Sweden. Their data showed a 10-30x higher airborne exposure to metals in recycling workers compared to office workers. The exposure biomarkers confirmed significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals, including lead, in the blood and urine of recycling workers. Julander and her associates published their study for anyone interested in the effects of heavy-metals in different occupations. Although there is limited exploration on lead-exposure, Julander et al. also examine the workers’ exposure to other dangerous substances such as mercury, arsenic, and chromium, making the information valuable to workers in many industries. Furthermore, the research is contemporary and Julander is a reliable scientists. She has posted 33 research papers in various journals, 30 articles, and this particular study has been cited over 726 times. Many of her other works such as “Comparison of metal release in two different artificial sweat solutions” (2016) and “Snapshot of cobalt, chromium, and nickel exposure in dental technicians” (2016) also focus on heavy metal exposure in various professions. However, some limitations for this research are that it is very specific and may be limited only to e-waste workers in Sweden. },

  volume={22},
  number={3},
  pages={213--239},
  year={1979},
  publisher={BOHS}
summary={The objective of King et al.’s study was to relate blood lead level and other biological response parameters to personal exposure to airborne lead dust. The scientists ensured to take into account particle size and solubility as they predicted that these factors would affect deposition and absorption of the lead. The study was carried out at 3 factories over a 3-month period but failed to establish a correlation between lead blood and dust exposure for any particle size or solubility. King et al. conclude that lead-in-air measurements are unsuitable for use as a primary hygiene standard for lead, although they remain useful as warnings that environmental conditions have changed. The intended audience of this work include scientists, researchers, and academics. It is not aimed at a general audience as it is complex and requires sound scientific understanding to understand completely. The study is disadvantageous as it fails to establish any relationships between blood lead level and exposure to dust particles; however, it does point out the need for further studies in this field as it could potentially improve lead-in-air contamination. E.J. King has published over 240 other studies for various institutes, such as The National Institutes of Health, and D.M. Heitt has published numerous articles for The British Journal of Industrial Medicine since the 1970s. All the researchers who were involved in this study are reputable, and thus, their findings, although inconclusive, should be taken seriously. },

summary = {Lanphear is an expert epidemiologist and Professor at Simon Fraser University. In this study, he explores the debate surrounding subclinical lead toxicity, defined as a blood level of 10mg per deciliter of higher, which affects 1 in 20 children in the USA. He analyzes past research that have established the need for primary prevention (elimination of residential lead hazards before a child is exposed). From here, he discovered that, paradoxically, current practices and policies rely exclusively on secondary prevention efforts (reducing a child’s exposure to lead after he/ she has been exposed and diagnosed). He argues that a scientific strategy to eliminate subclinical lead toxicity from residential lead hazards must be established. Although this research was published in 1998, it contains opinions and information that remain insightful for today’s policymakers and researchers. It is intended for a general audience and this is reflected in the fact that it has been cited 112 times by magazines, other studies, and in scientific journals. Lanphear’s reliability is also bolstered by his position at the International Society for Children’s Health and the Environment, whose mission is to employ “integrative approaches to the protection of children from environmental toxins.” },

  volume={115},

  pages={549--555},
  year={1982},
  publisher={Oxford Univ Press}
summary={ Moton, Saah, and Silberg created a case control study in Oklahoma in 1978 to determine whether the children of battery-manufacturing plant workers have a higher prevalence of higher blood lead levels. They studied these children against children whose parents worked in other professions. Their results showed that the blood lead levels of the studied children were significantly higher than the controlled children. None of the control children had blood lead levels >30μg/dl, while 53% of the exposed children had blood lead levels of >30μg/dl. The scientists concluded that only good personal hygiene outside of the workplace was effective in containing lead. Merely changing clothes and shoes before leaving work was inadequate for lead containment. Although this study is a primary source, it is outdated and very limited to Oklahoma. Other similar studies, such as “Predictors of lead absorption in children of lead workers” (J. Chan, M. Sim, R. Golec, and A. Forbes. 2000) have been conducted more recently. Furthermore, the scientists themselves do not have a reputable presence online, and this is reflected in the fact that this particular study has only been cited 52 times despite being published in 1982. },

 summary = {Penrose’s study examines past approaches to protecting the health of lead workers in the battery industry. He investigates the treatment of lead workers in the United States between 1920-1960 and found that the precautionary principle was rejected for the use of lead because medical knowledge was politicized. The effects of lead have left many of these workers’ lives in jeopardy. Penrose hopes that his research will help inform current debates over the use of lead. This account is a secondary source as although Penrose looks at data trends to form his conclusions, these data were collected by other researchers. It is neither a firsthand nor current account. Nevertheless, it remains relevant as Penrose can evaluate the consequences of historical lead-exposure and suggest improvements for current lead regulations and policies. The intended audience of this work include policy makers, labor historians, and scientists. Policy makers who wish to improve regulations in the lead industry can assess its effects from past evidence, labor historians can examine the development of workers’ protection, and scientists can benefit from better understanding which aspects of occupational lead-exposure warrant further study.},

  author={Schwartz, Brian S and Stewart, WF and Bolla, KI and Simon, D and Bandeen-Roche, K and Gordon, B and Links, JM and Todd, AC},
  journal={Neurology},
  volume={55},
  number={8},
  pages={1144--1150},
  year={2000},
  publisher={AAN Enterprises}
summary = {Schwartz et al. designed an experimental study to determine whether adults with past exposure to neurotoxicants have progressive declines in cognitive function after exposure has ceased. They also aimed to find out whether tibia lead is a determining factor in the magnitude of cognitive change, if any. The researchers studied 535 former lead-manufacturing workers and 118 controls twice a week over a 4-year period. Their data established that cognitive function can progressively decline due to past occupational exposures to a neurotoxicant. Schwartz works at the Division of Occupational and Environmental Health and John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. His findings in this study are significant, as him and his associates were the first to suggest such a conclusion. This work is a reliable primary source as the study was designed and undertaken under the supervision of Schwartz, who is a highly reputable scientist. His works have been cited over 10,500 times and he has written papers on neurotoxic exposures with other renowned scientists and by himself. Although this research was published over a decade ago, the topic it covers remains relevant, if not more so, in current times. },

  booktitle={Molecular, clinical and environmental toxicology},
  pages={133--164},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Springer}
summary = {In this study, Tchounwou and Yedjou review human carcinogens (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury) by analysing their environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenicity. They discuss how industrial uses of lead in paints, ceramic products, and pipe solder have declined in recent decades. Yet, despite this, 25% of the 16.4 million US homes studied still had significant amounts of lead-contaminated deteriorated paint, dust, or adjacent bare soil. This is concerning as these substances contribute to the rising blood-lead concentration levels in children who are exposed to lead through dust and chips of these deteriorating structures. This work is of value as it is current and written by Tchounwou and Yedjou, who are experts in cancer research. It is beneficial to scientists and students interested in health and/or heavy metals. The study being a secondary account does not necessarily give it a disadvantage; on the contrary, the researchers were able to evaluate and reflect on the evolution of heavy metal exposure research. Finally, although lead only makes up a small section of the study, Tchounwou and Yedjou have ensured a very comprehensive and detailed account of its uses and impact on the environment. All of their statements are backed up by reliable scientific evidence from the past. },

  title={Lead toxicity: a review},
  author={Ab Latif Wani, Anjum Ara and Usmani, Jawed Ahmad},
  journal={Interdisciplinary Toxicology},
  volume={8},
  number={2},
  pages={55},
  year={2015},
  publisher={Slovak Toxicology Society}
summary={This review of lead toxicity is a secondary source that scrutinizes historical data and notes important observations. The authors explore how lead is still currently used excessively in developing countries, despite it being regulated in developed nations such as Canada and North America. Using past research, Wani, Ara and Usmani confirm that lead is highly persistent in the environment because of its continuous use in almost every country. They also examine the toxicity of lead and its effects on the renal, reproductive, and nervous system. Finally, the writers discuss techniques for treating lead toxicity and current breakthroughs in this field. The merit of this study lies in its valuability for the intended audience: neuroscientists and doctors who wish to understand the effects of lead exposure on the brain. Wani, Ara, and Usmani have collaboratively undertaken other studies relating to neuropsychology, such as “Understanding adult neurogenesis beyond its role in learning and memory function.” (2016) Even though the writers are not experts in heavy metals, this particular work focuses on filtering existing knowledge and forming hypotheses and conclusions, practices that Wani, Ara, and Usmani have shown great competence in in the past.},
