@article{cardwell_cd_2013,
	title = {Do {Cd}, {Cu}, {Ni}, {Pb}, and {Zn} biomagnify in aquatic ecosystems?},
	volume = {226},
	issn = {0179-5953},
	abstract = {In this review, we sought to assess from a study of the literature whether five in organic metals (viz., cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc) bio magnify in aquatic food webs. We also examined whether accumulated metals were toxic to consumers/predators and whether the essential metals (Cu and Zn and possibly Ni) behaved differently from non-essential ones (Cd and Pb). Biomagnification potential was indexed by the magnitude of single and multiple trophic transfers in food chains. In this analysis, we used three lines of evidence-laboratory empirical, biokinetic modeling, and field studies-to make assessments. Trophic transfer factors, calculatedfrom lab studies, field studies, and biokinetic modeling, were generally congruent.Results indicated that Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn generally do not biomagnify in food chains consisting of primary producers, macro invertebrate consumers, and fish occupying TL 3 and higher. However, bio magnification of Zn (TTFs of 1-2) is possible for circumstances in which dietary Zn concentrations are below those required for metabolism. Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn may biomagnify in specific marine food chains consisting of bivalves, herbivorous gastropods, and barnacles at TL2 and carnivorous gastropods at TL3. There was an inverse relationship between TTF and exposure concentration for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, a finding that is consistent with previous reviews of bioconcentration factors and bioaccumulation factors for metals. Our analysis also failed to demonstrate a relationship between the magnitude of TTFsand dietary toxicity to consumer organisms. Consequently, we conclude that TTFs for the metals examined are not an inherently useful predictor of potential hazard(i.e., toxic potential) to aquatic organisms. This review identified several uncertainties or data gaps, such as the relatively limited data available for nickel, reliance upon highly structured food chains in laboratory studies compared to the unstructured food webs found in nature, and variability in TTFs between the organisms found in different habitats, and years sampled.},
