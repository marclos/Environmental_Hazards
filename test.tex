\section{Introduction}

\section{Driving Question}

Does racism cause environmental hazard?

\section{Public Product}

Each student will create a map the evaluates how environmental hazards are spatially distributed and evaluate factors that cause this exposure risks.


\section{Learning Outcomes}

Students will be able to: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Collect and analyze metal concentrations from soil.
  \item Map environmental hazards
  \item Analyze spatial data using demographics and hazards

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Toxic Release Inventory Program}

The US EPA runs a program called the \href{https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program}{Toxic Release Inventory}. The program relies on emitters of toxic pollutants to report their releases on an annual?? basis. 

\subsection{TRI Chemicals}

The TRI Program requires emitters to report on the following types of chemicals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cancer or other chronic human health effects;
  \item Significant adverse acute human health effects; and
  \item Significant adverse environmental effects.
\end{itemize}

The \href{https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/tri_chemical_list_for_ry15_11_5_2015_1.xlsx}{current TRI toxic chemical list} contains 594 individually-listed chemicals and 31 chemical categories (including four categories containing 68 specifically-listed chemicals).
